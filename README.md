# Hi
I build things from scratch all across the stack in the age of vibecoding and `npm install doStuffLibrary`.

From processor implementations in Verilog to avionics firmware and crafting assemblers/compilers, I thrive on understanding and building every layer. Currently learning JavaScript to complete the whole stack from silicon to slop.

## (Public) Projects:
- [**operator**](https://github.com/akkaygin/operator), a cursed programming language where everything is an infix operator
- [**Advent of Code 2015**](https://github.com/akkaygin/AoC-2015), the OG AoC solutions in Python, nothing shiny
- [**sol32**](https://github.com/akkaygin/sol32pt), a CPU design journey that taught me a lot about compilers and processors - with a better version cooking in the lab
- [**glasscell**](https://github.com/akkaygin/glasscell), a sol32 implementation in systemverilog for accurate physical simulation and a graphical frontend made using raylib

I have a lot more private ones though
