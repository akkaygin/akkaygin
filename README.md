# Hi
I _attempt to_ build things from scratch all across the stack in the age of vibecoding and `pip install doStuffLibrary`
- Hardware: Implementing a whole SoC in Verilog
- Firmware: Writing avionics software for a rocket
- Software: Creating assemblers and compilers in C and getting work done in Python (moving to JavaScript)

## (Public) Projects:
- [**sol32**](https://github.com/akkaygin/sol32pt), a dead CPU design that taught me a lot about compilers and processors - with a better version cooking in the lab
- [**operator**](https://github.com/akkaygin/operator), a cursed programming language where everything is an infix operator
- [**Advent of Code 2015**](https://github.com/akkaygin/AoC-2015), the OG AoC solutions in Python, nothing shiny

I have a lot more unfinished ones though
